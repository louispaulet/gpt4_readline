Stochastic search optimization approaches It is important to understand the advantages and limitations of RL compared to other approaches for program optimization. As such, we implemented a state-of-the-art stochastic superoptimization approach8, adapted it to the sort setting and used it as the learning algo- rithm in AlphaDev. We refer to this variant as AlphaDev-S (see Methods for more details). We run this algorithm with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S opti- mizes for a latency proxy, namely algorithm length and, then, at the end of training, we search through all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S and benchmark each one to find the lowest latency solution. In general, we find that AlphaDev consistently outperforms AlphaDev-S when learning from scratch without previous knowledge. In addition, as the size of the program increases, AlphaDev explores orders of magnitude fewer programs (12 million programs in the worst case) compared to AlphaDev-S (31 trillion programs in the worst case). This may be because AlphaDev is able to better explore the space of algorithms compared to the breadth-first stochastic search proce- dure that gets stuck more easily into local optima; see Methods for an overview of this exploration hypothesis. In addition, AlphaDev never evaluates latency during search as it uses the latency value function predictions and, because of this, only needs to compute actual meas- ured latency on less than 0.002% of generated programs. When incor- porating previous knowledge into AlphaDev-S, such as warm starting the learning algorithm with a near-optimal solution, AlphaDev-S is more computationally efficient for sort 3, sort 4 and sort 5 (branch- less assembly algorithms) and also generates competitive low-latency algorithms to that of AlphaDev in each case. However, for algorithms that require branching (ifâ€“else statements), in which algorithm length

and latency are not well correlated, AlphaDev discovers lower latency solutions than AlphaDev-S, even when warm starting this algorithm with a near-optimal solution. See Methods for an in-depth analysis of these algorithms.
