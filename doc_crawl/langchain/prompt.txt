For each link in this list, read it.

----

When you are done learning about Langchain, please write a simple langchain app that allows a user to ask questions to a pdf of several pages.
The pdf file to use as input is located here:

https://github.com/louispaulet/gpt4_readline/blob/main/simple%20text/wikipedia_sarkozy_simple_pdf.pdf

No need to read this file, just use the link as the input for one function.


Remember, you goal is to:
1. learn how to use Langchain by reading a list of links
2. write a demo app that takes a pdf at a URL and saves it into a vector database
3. write a demo QA app for google colab to allow a user to query the database for answers.

You can use openAI api if needed. I would like the vector database to be local, use any technology suitable for storing multi-page pdfs.
Write code in code blocks, in the style of a python expert.
